def get_initial_prompt(model: str):
    '''
    Placeholder function. In time will be fleshed out so
    that users can take advantage of different models' 
    capabilites with more expansive prompts. GPT-3 models
    have less token allowance than GPT-4, so their prompts 
    are necessarily smaller. GPT-4 prompts will be more 
    expansive.

def get_memories(model: str):
    '''
    Placeholder function. Will work with memories
    in a way that depends on the model. For example,
    GPT-4 will have a larger memory text prompt.
